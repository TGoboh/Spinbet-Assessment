**Problem**
The challenge involves developing automated scripts using Cypress for the following scenarios on the SpinBet website:

Registration Process on SpinBet Registration
Search Functionality in the Casino Lobby on SpinBet Casino

**Solution**
This script will help to validate the registration process and search functionality on the SpinBet platform to get much faster and accurate result. The tests will ensure that:

Users can successfully register on the SpinBet platform.
The search functionality in the Casino Lobby works correctly, retrieving relevant results based on the input query.

**Reasoning Behind Technical Choices**
Cypress
I chose to go with cypress because I am good with cypress, I was instructed to use cypress, and cypress offers the following advantages:

Ease of Use: Cypress is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it easier to write, run, and maintain tests.
Real-Time Reloads: It provides real-time reloads, allowing for instant feedback and faster test development.
Automatic Waiting: Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions, reducing the need for manual waits and improving test reliability.
Debugging: It offers powerful debugging capabilities, making it easier to troubleshoot and fix issues in tests.
Comprehensive Documentation: Cypress has extensive documentation and a supportive community, facilitating quick resolution of any issues encountered during test development.

Page Object Model
Page object Model was implemented because it offers Enhanced Readability and Maintainability, Reduced Code Duplication, as well as Simplicity in Test Maintenance.

**Cypress Installation**
To install the project dependencies, run the following command: npm install

**Usage**
To open the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command: npx cypress open
